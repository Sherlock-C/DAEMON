## ETALON: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Interpretation for Multivariate Time Series
ETALON is a robust time series anomaly detection model which uses two discriminators to learn the normal pattern of multivariate time series and uses the reconstruction error to determine anomalies and interpret the root cause.
